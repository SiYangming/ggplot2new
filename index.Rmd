No app is the product of a single person. There are many people who helped make this app possible, directly and indirectly. I’d like to thank the R community for creating R. Thanks to RStudio for creating RStudio and Shiny.

Thanks to Hadley Wickham who developed R package ggplot2. Thanks to Winston Chang who wrote the book R graphics cookbook and developed R package gcookbook. I was inspired by his book. For Koreans I strongly recommend my book “web-based anlaysis with R”.
