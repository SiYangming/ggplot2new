## Acknowledgements

No app is the product of a single person. There are many people who helped make this app possible, directly and indirectly. I'd like to thank the R community for creating R. Thanks to RStudio for creating RStudio and Shiny.

Thanks to Hadley Wickham who developed R package [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html). Thanks to Winston Chang who wrote the book [`R graphics cookbook`](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do) and developed R package [`gcookbook`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gcookbook/index.html). I was inspired by his book. For Koreans I strongly recommend my book "web-based anlaysis with R".
